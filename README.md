The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method. It’s about getting maximum productivity from your available time. 

It’s actually very simple. It’s about breaking down your work into separate jobs and then using a timer to separate your time into periods of intensive work and short breaks.

First of all, you should think about the task you need to complete. When you are ready to start you set the timer to 25 minutes and you start working on the first item on the list.

When the timer goes off you must take a short break of between 3 to 5 minutes. You should try to move about a bit during the break.

That's it, thanks for reading and I hope it would be helpful for you.
